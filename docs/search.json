I enjoy travelling, photography and outdoor activities like frisbee and hiking. What I love about all these activities is the ability to capture memoriable moments and get to know more people and culture.\nIn here, you’ll find the links to my Github from my journey in NM2207 and have the opportunity to explore my data story project and browse some of my personal photos that I took recently.\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy exploring!!!"

    "text": "About\nAs part of the final project of NM2207, we are tasked to create a data story from our choice of data set. In view of that, I’ve chosen to base my data story and project on a data set I’ve found about Spotify.\nAs someone who really loves to listen music, I’m interested to explore any observable correlations between the popularity of Spotify songs and the elements of the music to find out if there are specific factors that influences the popularity of music.\n \n\n\nObservations\nBy examining the graph plotted in my interactive shiny app, I observe a weak positive correlation between the music’s popularity and its Beats.Per.Minute (Figure 1). This correlation suggests that the general public are more likely to remember upbeat songs due to the ability to dance to its fast beats (Byron & O’Regan, 2022).\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nYet, there is a weak negative correlation between the music’s popularity and its danceability (Figure 2). This may be attributed to how easy it is to dance according to the beat of the music. Based on the graph for Danceability versus Beats.Per.Minute (Figure 3), a weak negative correlation is also observed, indicating that dancing to the music becomes more challenging as the tempo increases.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nBoth of this correlation observed between the music’s popularity and its elements supports the argument of Madan and Singhal (2012) which state that the engagement of motor actions through fast-paced music eases the process of memory encoding and retrieval, causing the music to remain memorable and popular among the general public. \nAdditionally, I also observe a weak positive correlation between the music’s popularity and its speechiness, which refer to the number of words in the song (Figure 4). According to Byron and Regan (2022), the inclusion of words in music allows musical information to be stored and retrieved easily through many ways since words are used to interpret the world around us. This demonstrates how popular songs have lyrics that aid in both improving our understanding and retention of the music. \n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nOn the other hand, a weak negative correlation is observed between the music’s popularity and its valence, suggesting that people are more inclined to recall sad songs (Figure 5). This correlation observed may be attributed to individuals’ tendency to remember bad experiences more vividly than positive ones (Caren, 2018). As individuals tend to listen to sad songs when they encounter bad experiences, popular songs tend to have a sad connection in their music.\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nIn conclusion, there does not seem to be a strong correlation between the popularity of the music and the elements of the music. This weak positive correlation noticed between some of the elements of music and the popularity of music may be attributed to the sparsely distributed points on the generated plots. Nonetheless, the popularity of the music is still determined by its tempo, speechiness and valence. As the popularity of music is dependent on the memorability among the general public, these weak correlations reflect that people tend to remember based on movements, words and emotions."
