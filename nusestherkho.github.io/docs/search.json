I enjoy travelling, photography and outdoor activities like frisbee and hiking. What I love about all these activities is the ability to capture memoriable moments and get to know more people and culture.\nIn here, you’ll find the links to my Github from my journey in NM2207 and have the opportunity to explore my data story project and browse some of my personal photos that I took recently.\n\nHappy exploring!!!"
